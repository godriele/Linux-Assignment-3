# Task 1
1. What is the benefit of creating a system user for this task rather than using a regular user or root?

- The benefit of creating a system user for this task rather than using a regular user or root is that 
creating a system user limits access and permissions, which helps protect the system from security risks,
also keeps the services separate from other users and system processes.

it helps configuration organized, makes update easier and so you dont affect any other settings
