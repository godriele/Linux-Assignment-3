# Task 1
1. What is the benefit of creating a system user for this task rather than using a regular user or root?

- The benefit of creating a system user for this task rather than using a regular user or root is that 
creating a system user limits access and permissions, which helps protect the system from security risks,
also keeps the services separate from other users and system processes.

# Task 3

1. Why is it important to use a separate server block file instead of modifying the main nginx.conf file directly?
- Using a separate server block file instead of modifying the main nginx.conf file is important because
it helps configuration organized, makes update easier and so you dont affect any other settings 

2. How can you check the status of the nginx services and test your nginx configuration?
- To check the status of the nginx services and the my own nginx configuration, Run:
`sudo nginx -` 
This should output if the nginx configuration file test was successful
