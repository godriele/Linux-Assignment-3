user webgen; = this will specify the User that Nginx should run as, this will improve security since the user "webgen" 
system account and running a server as a regular user will limit the permissions. 


# Check the read me I explained why I had to add this two
types_hash_max_size 4096; = Made the hash table bigger so that Nginx will be able to hande more types of files
without running into problems

types_hash_bucket_zie 64; = this will help with the performance, if you have a large number of file types, this will
make sure Nginx handles them more efficiently 

include    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; = Will allow me to add a lot of website configurations to my server without 
modifying the main nginx.conf file every time. It will tell nginx to look inside the sites-enabled folder and to include them
